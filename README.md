# pixel-lightbar
Shell scripts and systemd services to manipulate your Chromebook Pixel's lightbar, for fun and profit! (Probably not a lot of profit here though so don't quit your day job.)

At some point, these will all be tweaked to work with the systemd services included; for now, the services are hardcoded to use the binary clock.

Static:
- Chromium colors
- Samus power suit colors
- Arbitrary color of your choosing

Dynamic:
- Binary clock (pretty much impossible to read but still pretty cool)
- Knight Rider
- Random color cycle
- Heartbeat
- Cloud shoving sun aside

Coming whenever, possibly never:
- Weather
- Mood
- CPU usage
- Digits of Pi
- Text file in Morse Code
